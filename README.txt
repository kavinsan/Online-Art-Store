Our team used localhost to create the website - for marking purposes, we hosted it on
the school server. The website can be viewed here:

http://www2.scs.ryerson.ca/~kthavane/CPS630A2/assignment2-Team4.php

Otherwise, our main file is assignment2-Team4.php which requires access to the database.
If one wishes to open on their localhost, we have the CREATE tables and INSERT statements
in SQLcommands.txt.
